Let's say we have a software product that is used by other businesses. One part
of the application helps them handle customer relationship management (CRM). It
only does a few things:

- It searches for customers by name.
- It finds the customer by their id.
- It has a method to update the customer's status.

Here's the customer class that handles represents record in the table :

```clike
public class Customer
{
  public int CustomerId;
  public string FirstName;
  public string LastName;
  public string CustomerStatus;
}
```

And here's the CRM class:

```clike
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class InHouseCustomerFinder
    {
      public List<Customer> Search(string searchText)
      {
        List<Customer> SearchResults = new List<Customer>();
        SQLService Service = new SQLService();
        SearchResults = Service.SearchCustomers(searchText);
        return SearchResults;
      }

      public Customer GetById(int customerId)
      {
        Customer Customer = new Customer();
        SQLService Service = new SQLService();
        Customer = Service.GetCustomerById(customerId);
        return Customer;
      }

      public Customer UpdateStatus(int customerId, string newStatus)
      {
        Customer UpdatedCustomer = new Customer();
        SQLService Service = new SQLService();
        Customer = Service.UpdateCustomerStatus(customerId, newStatus);
        return Customer;
      }
    }
```

The Search method takes the search text that user inputs, finds the records that
match the text in SQL, and returns a List of Customers that match the text. The
GetById method takes a CustomerId, finds the record in SQL, and returns the
customer. Easy.

We've never had a reason to change this code, but we have a problem. We have a
new client who already uses Salesforce to handle customer relationship
management. They want to use our product, but they will only do so if they can
use their existing CRM.

We could make a new
