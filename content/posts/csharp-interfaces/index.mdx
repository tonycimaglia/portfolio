ðŸŒ± This post is a part of my digital garden. It's a place where ideas grow. It's
not a polished article, but more of a living breathing breathing document. ðŸŒ±

not a user interface

Lets say our software was used by multiple clients.
Many of those clients use SalesForce for as a CRM (customer relationship management) tool.
Others use our own internal CRM tool with the data stored in SQL.

```clike
public class Customer
{
 string Name {get set};
 bool WithdrawFunds ( decimal amount );
 decimal GetBalance ();
}
```

```clike
public interface ICRMProvider
{
 void PayInFunds ( decimal amount );
 bool WithdrawFunds ( decimal amount );
 decimal GetBalance ();
}
```
