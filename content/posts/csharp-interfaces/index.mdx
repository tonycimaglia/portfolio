## Interfaces

So, what is an interface anyway?.

Let's say we have a software product called Deco that is used by other
businesses. One part of the application helps them handle customer relationship
management (CRM). It only does a few things:

- It searches for customers by name.
- It finds the customer by their id.
- It has a method to update the customer's status.

Here's the customer class that represents each record in the table :

```clike
public class Customer
{
  public int CustomerId;
  public string FirstName;
  public string LastName;
  public string CustomerStatus;
}
```

And here's the CRM class:

```clike
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class DecoCRM
    {
      public List<Customer> Search(string searchText)
      {
        List<Customer> SearchResults = new List<Customer>();
        SQLService Service = new SQLService();
        SearchResults = Service.SearchCustomers(searchText);
        return SearchResults;
      }

      public Customer GetById(int customerId)
      {
        Customer Customer = new Customer();
        SQLService Service = new SQLService();
        Customer = Service.GetCustomerById(customerId);
        return Customer;
      }

      public Customer UpdateStatus(int customerId, string newStatus)
      {
        Customer UpdatedCustomer = new Customer();
        SQLService Service = new SQLService();
        Customer = Service.UpdateCustomerStatus(customerId, newStatus);
        return Customer;
      }
    }
```

- The Search method takes the search text that user inputs, finds the records
  that match the text in SQL, and returns a List of Customers that match the
  text.
- The GetById method takes a CustomerId, finds the record in SQL, and returns
  the customer. Easy.
- The UpdateStatus method takes in the customerId and the newStatus, updates the
  record in the table, and returns the updated Customer.

The compnay has never had a reason to change this code, but there's a problem.
They're courting a new client who already uses Salesforce to handle customer
relationship management. They want to use Deco's software, but they will only do
so if they can use their existing CRM.

They could create a brand new class with it's own methods
