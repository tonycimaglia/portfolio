ðŸŒ± This post is a part of my digital garden. It's a place where ideas grow.
It's not a "showpiece" or polished article, but more of a living breathing breathing document. ðŸŒ±

#### August 2020

Started playing with the idea of looking for my next role.
I didn't want to rely on recruiters like I have in the past, and I started looking for companies that I really wanted to work for.
Microsoft wasn't on my radar until a freind suggested I look into it given the experience I have.
I looked into their Atlanta plans, researched the company, and decided that's where I wanted to be.
On August 5th, I rebuilt my personal site. I picked a Gatsby theme with a blog built in because I really wanted to start creating content more than anything else.
I also got a lot more active on twitter to keep up with what's happening with .NET and Azure.
I signed up for a profile in microsoft's career portal.
I created a new resume and cover letter tailored to jobs I saw open up in Atlanta.
I applied to 5 jobs or so that I was qualified for. Even though I just started looking, I figured why wait, you never know.
I thought I would start heading down a .NET 5 path in terms of the next thing I learn.
I really got interested in Azure though, and I started studying for my AZ-900 exam.
Watched and took notes on about 1/3 of Andrew Brown's free Azure Fundamentals.

#### September 2020

Continued studying for the AZ-900 Exam.
I got really sick, along with my wife and son which set me back about 2 weeks.
Created a garden entry about the pomodoro technique and the current entry you're reading.
