#### August 2020

Started playing with the idea of looking for my next role.
I didn't want to rely on recruiters like I have in the past, and I started looking for companies that I really wanted to work for.
Microsoft wasn't on my radar until a freind suggested I look into it given the experience I have.
I decided they were the company for me.
On August 5th, I rebuilt personal site. I picked a Gatsby theme with a blog built in because I really wanted to start creating content more than anything else.
I also got a lot more active on twitter.
I signed up for a profile in microsoft's career portal.
