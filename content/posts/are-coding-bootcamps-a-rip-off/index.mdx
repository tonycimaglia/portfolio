### Wait, what do I know?
  After working in restaurants for a decade, I started having back issues in 2017. 
  On top of that, I was no longer finding any joy in the work I was doing. I was desperate for a career change.
  - After doing very little research, and even less coding, I signed up to attend a 3 month immersive coding bootcamp at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive/atlanta "General Assembly").
  - 1 week after my graduation, I got my first full time software engineering role. 
  - I have experience with the other side of the bootamp business.
      - I worked as a teaching assistant at the [Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp](https://bootcamp.pe.gatech.edu/coding "Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp")
      - I was offered a teaching assistant position at General Assembly on a track to be a lead instructor.
      - I've been interviewed to be a lead instructor at [Digital Crafts](https://www.digitalcrafts.com/ "Digital Crafts").
  - I started working as a software engineer for an insurance software company after my contract at my first job ended which is where I still work today.

### How much do coding bootcamps cost?
  According to Course Report coding bootcamps on average cost [$13,584](https://www.coursereport.com/reports/coding-bootcamp-market-size-research-2019 "").
  Going to General Assembly cost me $15,000, and Digital Crafts's immersive course costs the same amount. Georgia Tech's program costs $10,000. 

### What are you actually getting for the money?
  - Pre Course Work (usually a short course to get you up to speed on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals)
  - Curriculum
    - I have yet to see anything in a bootcamp's curriculum that doesn't have a free quivalent online.
  The Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp's curriculum is especaially misleading. It's developed by an outside company, Trilogy Education. 
  Most of the marketing materials make it seem as though you're attending a bootcamp created by GT. In reality, they've passed off Trilogy's curriculum as their own.
  - Instruction from Industry Professionals 
    - instruction from and "expert" one of my teachers taught himself ruby that month. one didn't like people one knew "everything"
  - In person learning (sometimes)
  - Career Services. Someone who gives you basic guidance about how to write a resume / interview. 
  - Demo Day (a day to show off your projects to potential employers in person)

### But wait, you were successful
  Survivor's bias:

  That's true. However:
  My cohort at General Assembly was the best case scenario.
  The class was small (20 people) we had AT LEAST 2 instructors the entire time, and everyone was
  self-motivated and supported one another. When I worked at Georgia Tech, the class was massive, (around 70 people)
  the instructors were both first time teachers, and every student paid $10,000 to be there. In my opinion, no. 


### Coding Bootcamp Failure
  For every person like me who was successful, there's another who dropped out of the course before finishing. 
  There's someone who never found a job, gave up, and went back to their old career $15,000 in debt. 
  There's another person who's still looking for a job.
### Coding Bootcamp Success
  you can be successful and still not get your money's worth.
#### You can teach yourself at your own pace
  one thing all bootcamps stress is that you have to learn how to teach yourself things, which is true of being a dev
  they don't actually teach you how to do that though!
  the fact that bootcamps exist is proof that you can learn these things yourself
  you don't need a special degree, it's not like being a nurse (who are saints by the way and none of us are worthy)
  i did not retain anything from my immersive class!
##### Covid-19 
  why on earth would you pay the same amount of money for an online experience?
  no demo day, no in person, no campus, no benefits
  start self teaching and building a network online
  these schools still want the same amount of tuition.
  more desperate jobless people out there. 

### So, Are Coding Bootcamps Worth The Money?
  In case it hasn't been obvious what my thoughts are, no. 
  never trust a business that wants to profit from selling you the image of a new
  career and your hopes of improving your life for a profit
