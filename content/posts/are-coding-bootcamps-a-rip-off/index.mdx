A value of 100 is the peak popularity for a term on Google Trends over a given period of time. With millions of people losing their jobs, interest in bootcamps has never been higher than it was in July of 2020.

### Wait, what do I know?
  After working in restaurants for a decade, I started having back issues in 2017. 
  On top of that, I was no longer finding any joy in the work I was doing. I was desperate for a career change.
  - After doing very little research, and even less coding, I signed up to attend a 3 month immersive coding bootcamp at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive/atlanta "General Assembly").
  - 1 week after my graduation, I got my first full time software engineering role. 
  - I have experience with the other side of the bootamp business.
      - I worked as a teaching assistant at the [Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp](https://bootcamp.pe.gatech.edu/coding "Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp")
      - I was offered a teaching assistant position at General Assembly on a track to be a lead instructor.
      - I've been interviewed to be a lead instructor at [Digital Crafts](https://www.digitalcrafts.com/ "Digital Crafts").
  - I started working as a software engineer for an insurance software company after my contract at my first job ended which is where I still work today.

### How much do coding bootcamps cost?
  According to Course Report coding bootcamps on average cost [$13,584](https://www.coursereport.com/reports/coding-bootcamp-market-size-research-2019 "").
  Going to General Assembly cost me $15,000, and Digital Crafts's immersive course costs the same amount. Georgia Tech's program costs $10,000. 

### What are you actually getting for the money?
  - Pre-Course Work 
    - A self-guided course to get you up to speed on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals.
  - Curriculum
    - Usually, some kind of JavaScript centric approach to learning full-stack development.
  - Instruction from Industry Professionals
    - The level of teaching and professional experiece, quality, and effectiveness of instructors varies widely. 
  - The drive you get from the excitement of your peers.
    - Much of this benefit is lost when attending an online bootcamp.
  - Career Services.
    - Someone who gives you basic guidance about how to write a resume / interview / look for jobs. 
  - Demo Day 
    - A day to show off your projects to potential employers in person. Again, this benefit is not as great online.
  - Access to the bootcamp's professional network. 

### So, Are Coding Bootcamps Worth The Money?
  I think if the stars align and you have the best case scenario, then, well... maybe? 
  I genuinely believe my cohort at General Assembly was as good as it gets. The instructors were great.
  We had 2 instructors in the class for the entire course, and only about 20 students. My class was extremely motivated.
  They encouraged one another and worked through challenges together. This isn't always the case.
