### Wait, what do I know?
  After working in restaurants for a decade, I started having back issues in 2017. 
  On top of that, I was no longer finding any joy in the work I was doing. I was desperate for a career change.
  After doing very little research, and even less coding, I signed up to attend a 3 month immersive coding bootcamp at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive/atlanta "General Assembly").
  I was immediately successful afterwards. I got a job at a web agency, I worked as a teaching assistant at the Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp,
  I was offered a teaching assistant position at General Assembly, 
  and I've been interviewed to be a lead instructor at Digital Crafts. 
### Are Coding Bootcamps Worth The Money?
  My cohort at General Assembly was the best case scenario.
  The class was small (20 people) we had AT LEAST 2 instructors the entire time, and everyone was
  self-motivated and supported one another. When I worked at Georgia Tech, the class was massive, (around 70 people)
  the instructors were both first time teachers, and every student paid $10,000 to be there. In my opinion, no. One of the first thing's I realized, is that I paid $15,000 to be
  taught curriculum that's alread available online.
  i paid 15k
  GA still wants 15k
  no campus experience
  no demo day
  immersive formats aren't condusive to learning
## Coding Bootcamp Failure
  For every person like me who was successful, there's another who dropped out of the course before finishing. 
  There's someone who never found a job, gave up, and went back to their old career $15,000 in debt. 
  There's another person who's still looking for a job.
### Coding Bootcamp Success
  you can be successful and still not get your money's worth
#### You can teach yourself at your own pace
  the fact that bootcamps exist is proof that you can learn these things yourself
  you don't need a special degree, it's not like being a nurse
##### Covid-19 
  why on earth would you pay the same amount of money for an online experience?
###### Profiting off your dreams
  never trust a business that wants to profit from selling you the image of a new
  career and your hopes of improving your life for a profit
