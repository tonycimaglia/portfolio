A value of 100 is the peak popularity for a term on Google Trends over a given period of time. With millions of people losing their jobs, interest in bootcamps has never been higher than it was in July of 2020.

### Wait, what do I know?
  After working in restaurants for a decade, I started having back issues in 2017. 
  On top of that, I was no longer finding any joy in the work I was doing. I was desperate for a career change.
  - After doing very little research, and even less coding, I signed up to attend a 3 month immersive coding bootcamp at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive/atlanta "General Assembly").
  - 1 week after my graduation, I got my first full time software engineering role. 
  - I have experience with the other side of the bootamp business.
      - I worked as a teaching assistant at the [Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp](https://bootcamp.pe.gatech.edu/coding "Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp")
      - I was offered a teaching assistant position at General Assembly on a track to be a lead instructor.
      - I've been interviewed to be a lead instructor at [Digital Crafts](https://www.digitalcrafts.com/ "Digital Crafts").
  - I started working as a software engineer for an insurance software company after my contract at my first job ended which is where I still work today.

### How much do coding bootcamps cost?
  According to Course Report coding bootcamps on average cost [$13,584](https://www.coursereport.com/reports/coding-bootcamp-market-size-research-2019 "").
  Going to General Assembly cost me $15,000, and Digital Crafts's immersive course costs the same amount. Georgia Tech's program costs $10,000. 

### What are you actually getting for the money?
  - Pre-Course Work 
    - A self-guided course to get you up to speed on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals.
  - Curriculum
    - Usually, some kind of JavaScript centric approach to learning full-stack development.
  - Instruction from Industry Professionals
    - The level of teaching and professional experiece, quality, and effectiveness of instructors varies widely. 
  - The drive you get from the excitement of your peers.
    - Much of this benefit is lost when attending an online bootcamp.
  - Career Services.
    - Someone who gives you basic guidance about how to write a resume / interview / look for jobs. 
  - Demo Day 
    - A day to show off your projects to potential employers in person. Again, this benefit is not as great online.
  - Access to the bootcamp's professional network. 

### So, Are Coding Bootcamps Worth The Money?
  I think if the stars align and you have the best case scenario, then, well... not really. I think my cohort at General Assembly was about the best case scenario.
  You have to be EXTREMELY careful when you trust a business that wants to profit from selling you the image of a new
  career and your hopes of improving your life.


### Survivorship Bias
  Most of the stories you hear about bootcamps are from people who were successful. Everyone I spoke to who graduated from a bootcamp and got a full time job after
  might express displeasure in some aspect of the bootcamp, but for the most part, they all said that they thought it was worth it. They're willing to shrug off those 

### Coding Bootcamp Failure
  For every person like me who was successful, there's another who dropped out of the course before finishing. 
  There's someone who never found a job, gave up, and went back to their old career $15,000 in debt. 
  There's another person who's still looking for a job.
### Coding Bootcamp Success
  you can be successful and still not get your money's worth.
#### You can teach yourself at your own pace
  one thing all bootcamps stress is that you have to learn how to teach yourself things, which is true of being a dev
  they don't actually teach you how to do that though!
  the fact that bootcamps exist is proof that you can learn these things yourself
  you don't need a special degree, it's not like being a nurse (who are saints by the way and none of us are worthy)
  i did not retain anything from my immersive class!
### Covid-19 
  One of the things I've really been struggling to understand lately is why tuition to the schools costs the same for online only courses. 
  why on earth would you pay the same amount of money for an online experience?
  You're paying for their leases on empty buildings. 
  You miss out on having a campus to go to and work, having your peers around you to commiserate with.
  start self teaching and building a network online
  these schools still want the same amount of tuition.
  more desperate jobless people out there.
