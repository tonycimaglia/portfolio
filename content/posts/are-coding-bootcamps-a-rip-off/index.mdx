    # why am i an authority on this?
      attended general assembly (provide a link to their site)
      got a job
      worked as a TA at a different bootcamp
      was offered a job by general assembly
    # Are Coding Bootcamps Worth The Money?
      no
        i paid 15k
        GA still wants 15k
          no campus experience
          no demo day
          immersive formats aren't condusive to learning
    ## Coding Bootcamp Failure
      for every 1 person like me:
        theres one person who dropped out
        theres one person who's still looking
        theres another who looked and gave up
    ### Coding Bootcamp Success
      you can be successful and still not get your money's worth
    #### You can teach yourself at your own pace
      the fact that bootcamps exist is proof that you can learn these things yourself
      you don't need a special degree, it's not like being a nurse
    ##### Covid-19 
    ###### Profiting off your dreams
      never trust a business that wants to profit from selling you the image of a new
      career and your hopes of improving your life for a profit
