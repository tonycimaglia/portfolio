not a polished article, but more of a living breathing breathing document. ðŸŒ±

This guide is intended for those wanting to start with Angular. This walkthrough
tutorial will have you building an application in Angular from scratch, learning
about components, templates, directives, and dependency injection along the way.

I worked very briefly on an AngularJs code base at my first job in tech. Ever
since then, I've been working with React on personal projects and focused more
on learning vanilla JS and working with jQuery in a professional setting.
Recently, I was asked to learn about Angular for a job interview. I tried to
boil down what I've learned into a simple introduction.

## Prerequisites

There are a few things you should know in advance before you start playing
around with Angular. If you've never used JavaScript or the DOM at all before,
for example, I would get more familiar with those before trying to learn any
front-end framework.

Here are what I consider to be Angular prerequisites:

- Familiarity with HTML & CSS.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and programming.
- Basic understanding of the DOM.
- Familiarity with ES6 syntax and features.
- Node.js and npm installed globally.

## Goals

- Learn about essential Angular concepts and related terms, such as components,
- Build a very simple angular app that demonstrates the above concepts.

Here's the source code and a demo of the project:

- View Source on GitHub (maybe we'll get here)
- View Demo (maybe we'll get here)

## What is Angular?

- Angular is a JavaScript Framework - one of the most popular ones, with over
  69.9k stars on GitHub.
- Angular is an open-source project created by Google.

One of the most important aspects of Angular (and other front-end frameworks and
libraries) is the fact that you can create components, (which are like custom,
reusable HTML elements) to quickly and efficiently build user interfaces.

## Setup and Installation

The easiest way to set up an Angular project is using the Angular CLI. The
Angular CLI creates, manages, builds and test your Angular projects.

To install the cli globally, run the following code in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Once that finishes, run the following code one directory above where you want
the project to live:

```bash
ng new angular-tutorial
```

Once that finishes installing, move to the newly created directory and start the
project:

```bash
cd angular-tutorial && ng serve
```
