#### Having trouble with productivity
i couldn't get anything done
we have a loud 1 year old
under construction office
stressed out and anxious about everything

#### enter the pomodoro


#### working in restaurants
i worked in restaurants for ten years
i always thought with the fast part of my brain
didn't want to have 8 hour days zoom past me

#### seeing better solutions to problems
might think of something better after i bang my head at something for only 25 minutes
“Don’t cling to a mistake just because you spent a lot of time making it.”
