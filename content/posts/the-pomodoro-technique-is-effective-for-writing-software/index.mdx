🌱 This post is a part of my digital garden. It's a place where ideas grow.
It's not a polished article, but more of a living breathing breathing document. 🌱

#### The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique was invented by Francesco Cirillo.
It's an incredibly simple idea:

- Start a 25 minute timer.
- Work for 25 minutes straight with no distractions.
- Stop for a few minutes and do something else.
- Work again for 25 minutes
- Repeat this cycle, and after 4 sessions of work, take a longer break.

That's it. There are tons of articles and books about the subject, most of which are going to overcomplicate everything. (Can you imagine reading an entire book about setting a timer?)

#### Why Did I Start Using This Method?

I've barely had trouble focusing on tasks or paying attention my entire life.
However, when the pandemic entered full swing, I found myself unable to get anything done.
I was working from home with an active, loud 10 month old who just started walking.
I kept changing the room my ofice was in and shuffling the layout around.
Even once the office was settled, I was stressed out and anxious about everything that was going on in that world (and not much has changed on that front).

## The Benefits I Notice:

#### Staying on Track

How many times have you started a task, seen something in the code, and started and transitioned into doing something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT? For like, hours?
I like to write down exactly what I'm working on or trying to accomplish:

- "Create model, view, and controller for sign up screen."
- "Write the logic to conditionally render Finalize screen text."

Sometimes, I notice something else in the code in the middle of a task, and get completely lost in the weeds.
This still happens using the technique, but at least I only lose a maximum of 25 minutes when it does.

#### Measurable Productivity

About 70% of my time at my current job is spent writing code. If I actually spend that percentage of my day coding, and I get through around 8 cycles, I've had a fairly productive day.
It's not a perfect measure. Some days are spent in meetings, exchanging emails, or doing things that don't make sense to break up into time blocks.
Tracking the cycles has at least allowed me to put something quantifiable behind what a productive day looks like.

#### Perks besides focus

I worked in BUSY restaurants for ten years. You never really get a moment during your entire shift to
take a breath and use the slow-thinking portion of your brain. Often I find that when I break up my work flow,
I'm usually able to come up with better solutions.

#### Solving Problems AFK

might think of something better after i bang my head at something for only 25 minutes
“Don’t cling to a mistake just because you spent a lot of time making it.”
