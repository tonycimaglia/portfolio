#### The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique was invented by Francesco Cirillo. It's an incredibly
simple concept:

- Start a 25 minute timer.
- Work for 25 minutes straight with no distractions.
- Stop for a few minutes and do something else.
- Work again for 25 minutes
- Repeat this cycle, and after 4 sessions of work, take a longer break.

That's it. There are tons of articles and books about the subject, most of which
are going to overcomplicate everything. Can you imagine reading an entire book
about setting a timer?

#### Why Did I Start Using This Method?

I've never had trouble focusing on tasks or paying attention to anything in my
entire life. However, when the pandemic entered full swing, I found myself
unable to get ANYTHING done. I was working from home with an active, loud 10
month old who just started walking. I kept changing the room my office was
located in and shuffling the layout around. Even once the office was settled, I
was consumed with anxiety about everything that was going on in the world. So,
how did adhering to this system help me?

#### Staying on Track

I can't count how many times I've started a task, seen something in the code,
and transitioned into doing something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. To avoid this, I
started to write down exactly what I'm working on or trying to accomplish before
I start a timer:

- "Create model, view, and controller for sign up screen."
- "Write the logic to conditionally render check-out screen text."

I'm not a robot, so I still get lost in the sauce. Now though, I only lose a
maximum of 25 minutes when it happens.

#### Measurable Productivity

About two thirds of my time at my current job is spent writing code. If I
actually spend that portion of my day coding, and I get through around 8-10
cycles, I've had a fairly productive shift. It's not a perfect measure. Some
days are spent in meetings, exchanging emails, or working on things that don't
make sense to break up into time blocks. Tracking the cycles has at least
allowed me to put something quantifiable behind what an average, productive day
looks like.

#### Focus

Setting a timer really helps keeps me on task. I might check a text message to
make sure it's not urgent. I might even reflexively check twitter. But I
remember that I'm in the middle of a task and I get back on track. There's
almost never a message or tweet that can't wait 25 minutes.

#### Finding Better Solutions

People solve problems with the slow-thinking portion of thier brains. If I work
for long stretches without pausing however, it becomes easy to slip into
fast-brain thinking. That results in me writing code without thinking up front
about what the best solution might be. When I break up my work flow, I'm able to
think slowly for the entire cycle, and I'm usually able to come up with better
ideas.

#### Solving Problems When I Take Breaks

Sometimes I get so hellbent on trying to fix something I become tunnel-visioned
in my approach to trying to solve the problem. Whatever path I started down is
the path I continue down until the task is done. However, if I break up my
workflow and take a minute to breathe, I'll often come up with a much cleaner or
better solution.

#### It's Not For Everyone

I know a lot of people who like to get into the zone and code for hours as time
flies by. After working in restaurants for a decade and having my entire shift
whiz past me in the blink of an eye, I really enjoy a slower, more deliberate
approach to my work. If you're more like me, give the method a try for a week
and see how you like it.
