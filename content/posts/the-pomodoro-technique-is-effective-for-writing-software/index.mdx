🌱 This post is a part of my digital garden. It's a place where ideas grow.
It's not a polished article, but more of a living breathing breathing document. 🌱

#### Having trouble with productivity

I've never had trouble focusing on tasks or paying attention most of my life.
However, when the pandemic entered full swing, I found myself unable to get anything done.
I was working from home with an active, loud 10 month old who just started walking.
My office was never put together. My wife and I kept adjusting our house around trying to adapt.
Even once the office was settled, I was stressed out and anxious about everything that was happening.

#### Enter The Pomodoro

The Pomodoro Technique was invented by [name here].
There are a ton of articles and even a book about the subject.
But to put it simply:

- you work for 25 minutes straight with no distractions
- you stop for little and do something else
- you work again for 25 minutes
- You repeat this cycle, and after 4 sessions of work, you take a longer break

#### working in restaurants

i worked in restaurants for ten years
i always thought with the fast part of my brain
didn't want to have 8 hour days zoom past me

#### Perks besides focus

might think of something better after i bang my head at something for only 25 minutes
“Don’t cling to a mistake just because you spent a lot of time making it.”
