🌱 This post is a part of my digital garden. It's a place where ideas grow.
It's not a polished article, but more of a living breathing breathing document. 🌱

#### Having trouble with productivity

I've never had trouble focusing on tasks or paying attention to almost anything.
However, when the pandemic entered full swing, I found myself unable to get anything done.
I was working from home with an active, loud 10 month old who just started walking.
I kept changing the room my ofice was in and shuffling the layout around.
Even once the office was settled, I was stressed out and anxious about everything that was going on in that world (and not much has changed on that front).

#### Enter The Pomodoro

The Pomodoro Technique was invented by Francesco Cirillo.
It's an incredibly simple idea:

- Start a 25 minute timer.
- Work for 25 minutes straight with no distractions.
- Stop for a few minutes and do something else.
- Work again for 25 minutes
- Repeat this cycle, and after 4 sessions of work, take a longer break.

That's it. There are tons of articles and books about the subject, most of which are going to overcomplicate everything. (Can you imaging reading a whole book about setting a 25 minute timer?!)

#### Staying on Track

How many times have you started a task, seen something in the code, and started and transitioned into doing something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT? For like, hours?
I like to write down exactly what I'm working on or trying to accomplish:

- "Create model, view, and controller for sign up screen."
- "Write the logic to conditionally render Finalize screen text."

#### Perks besides focus

i worked in restaurants for ten years
i always thought with the fast part of my brain
didn't want to have 8 hour days zoom past me
might think of something better after i bang my head at something for only 25 minutes
