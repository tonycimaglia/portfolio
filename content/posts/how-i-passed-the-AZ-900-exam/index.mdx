ðŸŒ± This post is a part of my digital garden. It's a place where ideas grow.
It's not a polished article, but more of a living breathing breathing document. ðŸŒ±

A little info about the exam. 
Useful for anyone that works somewhere that uses Azure. 

I started watching Andrew Brown's video. Took my time with it.

Realized i couldn't reschedule my exam, so i had to take it.

Watched the video at 2X speed right before the exam.

Came close, scored a 688, needed a 700.

Realized that they changed the sylabus a week before i took it.

Link to the chnages in the sylabus.

Learned about Microsoft.Learn

Worked through 5 of the 6 modules in the course over the course of 4 days.

Took the exam again and passed. 

Next up, studying for the AZ-204 exam and completing some articles and open source work that I started.
