title: Five Things I Don't Understand
slug: '/five-things-i-dont-understand'

I was reading "Apprenticeship Patterns" by David H. Hoover and Adewele Oshinye. All of the patterns in the book are centered around a problem with context, and then a solution and action is provided for the problem. One of the patterns in the book is called "Expose Your Ignorance". 
The solution is to put the list where people can see it.
Refresh the list as your my work changes. 

I'm starting a new role on February 22nd.
I don't know anything about MANY of the skills listed in the job description. 

Five things I don't understand about my work:

1. ASP .NET Core
2. Entity Framework
3. LINQ
4. Web API design / best practices
5. OOP
