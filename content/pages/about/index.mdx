Hi! I'm Tony. I spent almost a decade in Atlanta working just about every position in the restaurant industry.
I started to lose my passion for the work, and started diving into old hobbies to try and find a new passion.
After flirting with photography, going back to college, and opening my own restaurant, I decided to attended a coding bootcamp.
I got a job the week after graduation, and I've been happily working as a software developer ever since.
