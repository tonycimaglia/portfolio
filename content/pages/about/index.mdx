Hi! I'm Tony. I spent almost a decade in Atlanta working just about every
position in the restaurant industry. I started to lose my passion for the work,
and started diving into old hobbies to try and find a new passion. I flirted
with the idea of being a photographer, going back to college, or opening my own
restaurant. After doing a little bit of coding in my free time, I decided to
leave restaurants and attended a coding bootcamp. I got my first job the week
after graduation, and I've been happily working as a software developer ever
since.
