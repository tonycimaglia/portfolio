ðŸŒ± This post is a part of my digital garden. It's a place where ideas grow.
It's not a polished article, but more of a living breathing breathing document. ðŸŒ±

#### A little background

In August, I started playing with the idea of looking for my next job in Software.
I didn't want to rely on recruiters like I have in the past, and I started looking for companies that I really wanted to work for.
Microsoft wasn't on my radar until a freind suggested I look into it given the experience I have.
I looked into their plans for their Atlanta office (where I live), researched the company, and decided that's where I wanted to be.

#### August 2020

On August 5th, I rebuilt my personal site. I picked a Gatsby theme with a blog built in because I really wanted to start creating content more than anything else.
I also got a lot more active on twitter to keep up with what's happening with .NET and Azure.
I signed up for a profile in microsoft's career portal.
I created a new resume and cover letter tailored to jobs I saw open up in Atlanta.
I applied to 5 jobs or so that I was qualified for. Even though I just started looking, I figured why wait, you never know.
I thought I would start heading down a .NET 5 path in terms of the next thing I learn.
I really got interested in Azure though, and I started studying for my AZ-900 exam.
Watched and took notes on about 1/3 of Andrew Brown's free Azure Fundamentals.

#### September 2020

Continued studying for the AZ-900 Exam.
I got really sick, along with my wife and son which set me back.
Created a garden entry about the pomodoro technique and the current entry you're reading.
Found out we were pregnant and that absolutley sent all the cogs to a grinding hault

#### October 2020

I signed up for a networking event at microsoft that i couldn't attend because I couldn't line up childcare.
Not only are we pregnant, it's twins! Help us.
My son needed an ear tube surgery.
I was still sick.
My wife has crippling morning sickness.
I MANAGED TO AT LEAST SCHEDULE THE AZ-900 EXAM.

November

I PASSED THE AZ-900 EXAM AND EARNED MY FIRST MICROSOFT CERTIFICATION!!!
I Went back and started working on my personal site again.
I started an article about passing the az-900 exam.
I modified this article.

December

I'm no longer going to add excuses into this every month. My life is incredibly busy. That isn't going to change any time soon and I'm happy getting anything done.
Applied to more jobs that opened up in Atlanta.
Started working through the Microsoft Learn Modules for the AZ-204 Exam.

January
