### Survivorship Bias
  Most of the stories you hear about bootcamps are from people who were successful. Everyone I spoke to who graduated from a bootcamp and got a full time job after
  might express displeasure in some aspect of the bootcamp, but for the most part, they all said that they thought it was worth it. They're willing to shrug off a lot of the glaring issues.  

### Coding Bootcamp Failure
  For every person who was successful, there's another who dropped out of the course before finishing. 
  There's someone who never found a job, gave up, and went back to their old career $15,000 in debt. 
  There's another person who's still looking for a job.
### Coding Bootcamp Success
  you can be successful and still not get your money's worth.
### You can teach yourself at your own pace
  one thing all bootcamps stress is that you have to learn how to teach yourself things, which is true of being a dev
  they don't actually teach you how to do that though!
  the fact that bootcamps exist is proof that you can learn these things yourself
  you don't need a special degree, it's not like being a nurse (who are saints by the way and none of us are worthy)
  i did not retain anything from my immersive class!
### Covid-19 
  One of the things I've really been struggling to understand lately is why tuition to the schools costs the same for online only courses. 
  why on earth would you pay the same amount of money for an online experience?
  You're paying for their leases on empty buildings. 
  You miss out on having a campus to go to and work, having your peers around you to commiserate with.
  start self teaching and building a network online
  these schools still want the same amount of tuition.
  more desperate jobless people out there.
